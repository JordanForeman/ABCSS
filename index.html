					<h3>What You'll Learn</h3>
					<p>Have you ever wondered how some beautiful and unique websites are created? Nowadays there are plenty of options available for creating and hosting sites that are for people who only want to control their content (<a target="_blank" href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a> for example), but the limited amount of designs available on these services leave much to be desired.</p>

					<p>Perhaps you're a bit artistic, and while some of the themes available to you are nice, they don't necessarily capture your personality. Or maybe you just had your first million-dollar idea - trust us, you'll have more - but don't know how to create your vision. Maybe you're tired of your current boring desk job, and would like to try something completely different. If you've ever wanted to <em>create</em> for the web - instead of just <em>consuming</em> from it - then read on!</p>

				<h2>The ABCs</h2>

				<p>With ABCSS, you'll start by learning the basic building blocks any great Front-End Developer should have. We've created three different <a href="#">courses</a> for you to take - each one building on the last. Feel like you already know what one course is teaching you? Move on to the next! You don't have to tackle them in any particular order, but a newbie might want to!</p>

					<a href="#">Layout and Design</a>

					<a href="#">Advanced Interactions</a>
					<p>The advanced interactions course takes a look at making our websites a bit more dynamic - both visually and via the use of data. With this course, we'll start to move away from building web<em>sites</em> towards building data-centered web <em>applications</em>.</p>
